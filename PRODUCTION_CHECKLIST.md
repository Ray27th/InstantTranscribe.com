### 2. Environment Variables

# Stripe Configuration (ADD THESE)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

1. Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
2. Any future expiry date and any 3-digit CVC
3. Test both successful and failed payments

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Before Launch:
1. **Replace test keys with live keys**:
   - `sk_live_...` for STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
   - `pk_live_...` for NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
   - Live webhook secret for STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

2. **Set up webhook endpoint**:
   - URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhook/stripe`
   - Enable events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`

3. **Configure domain**:
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to your production domain

4. **Test on production**:
   - Upload test file
   - Complete payment flow
   - Verify transcription works
   - Check webhook receives events

### Security Notes:
- Never commit `.env.local` to git (already in .gitignore)
- Use HTTPS for production (required by Stripe)
